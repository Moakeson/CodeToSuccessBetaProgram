        <p>I will be a junior in high school at the start of the next school year. I have a great work ethic.  I have been doing odd-jobs since I was a kid to buy something I wanted.  I also have had jobs as a sweeper at 2 different schools, but only because that was the only place I could work at that time.  I have earned my Eagle, and I am very proud of this accomplishment.  Another thing that I have done is the TechTrack course, which I was selected for, and I learned a lot about programming. I enjoy playing sports, mostly basketball, but I really enjoy all sports.</p>
        <p>I have completed the following courses through Code School: Front-end Foundations, Front-end Formations, CSS Cross-Country, Javascript Road Trip Parts 1-3, Javascript Best Practices, Try Git, Git Real 1 and 2, and Mastering GitHub</p>
